# express-ts-setup

This is a starter kit for creating Express.js applications with TypeScript. It provides a quick setup process to get your TypeScript-based Express app up and running.

## Installation

Install the package globally using npm:

```bash
npm install express-ts-setup
```

## Usage

After installation, follow these steps to set up your Express TypeScript project:

1. Run the setup command:

```bash
npx express-ts
```

This command will create the necessary files and folder structure for your TypeScript Express app.

2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run server
```

This command will start your Express server using `ts-node`, allowing you to run your TypeScript code directly without compilation.

3. Build the TypeScript files:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will compile your TypeScript files into JavaScript.

4. Run the built application:

```bash
npm run start
```

This command will run the compiled JavaScript files.

## Scripts

- `npm run server`: Starts the development server using `ts-node`
- `npm run build`: Compiles TypeScript files to JavaScript
- `npm run start`: Runs the compiled JavaScript application
